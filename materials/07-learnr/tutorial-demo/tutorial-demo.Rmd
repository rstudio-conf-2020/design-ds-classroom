## Topic 1

Hello, today we learn about `learnr`.

![Typo and Dorianne Gray](img/cats.jpg)

![Data science cycle](https://afit-r.github.io/public/images/data-science.png)

Some math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

## Topic 3

### Exercise checking

You can use the `count` function to count the number of observations in each level of a categorical variable.

How many automatic and how many manual transmission cars are in the data?

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r filter-solution}
mtcars %>%
  count(am)
```

```{r filter-check}
"Great job!"
```

## Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

### Independent questions

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

```{r var-types}
question(
  "Which of the following is a numerical variable?",
  answer("zip code", message = "Zip code is recoded using numbers, but it's not a numerical variable."),
  answer("height"),
  answer("handedness", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = "Fantastico!"
)
```

### Building questions

**Teacher salaries**

In this quiz we explore a dataset of teacher salaries from 2009-2010 for 71 teachers employed by the St. Louis Public School in Michigan, US.

The data are stored in a dataset called `teacher`.

The variables we will consider are:

- `degree`: Highest educational degree attained: BA (Bachelor's degree) or 
MA (Master's degree).
- `years`: Number of years employed by the school district.
- `total`: Total annual salary of the teacher.

First, let's predict `total` annual salary from the number of `years` of employment  
by the school district.

```{r q1, echo=FALSE}
question(
    "Which of the following is/are the correct way(s) to fit such a model in R?
    Check all that apply.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE, allow_retry = TRUE, type = "multiple",
    answer("`lm(teacher$total ~ teacher$years)`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`lm(total ~ years, data = teacher)`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`lm(years ~ total, data = teacher)`"),
    answer("`teacher %>% 
  lm(years ~ total, data = .)`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`teacher %>% lm(years ~ total)`", message = "`data` is not the first 
    argument in the `lm()` function, so we need to explicitly pass what comes 
    before the pipe operator to the second argument in this function.")
  )
```

Next, use the exercise chunk below to run one of the correct options from Question 1 to fit a model predicting `total` annual salary from the number of `years` of employment by the school district.

```{r lm-total-years-fit, exercise = TRUE}
# add your code here
```

```{r q2, echo=FALSE}
question(
    "Which of the following is the correct linear model for predicting `total` 
    annual salary from the number of `years` of employment by the school district?",
    random_answer_order = TRUE, allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer("$\\widehat{total} = 54,406 + 1,001~years$", correct = TRUE),
    answer("$total = 54,406 + 1,001~years$"),
    answer("$\\widehat{years} = 54,406 + 1,001~total$"),
    answer("$\\widehat{total} = 1,001 + 54,406~years$"),
    answer("$\\widehat{total} = 1,001 - 54,406~years$")
  )
```

## Sorting 

### Simple sorting question

```{r sorting}
# Define the answer options
insects <- c(
    "ant",
    "bumble bee",
    "cricket",
    "dragonfly"
  )

# Initialize the question
question_rank(
  "Sort these insects in alpabetical order:",
  answer(insects, correct = TRUE),
  answer(rev(insects), correct = FALSE, message = "Other direction!"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Parson's problems

**Note:** This is still experimental.

Suppose I want to calculate mean sepal length of each species of irises and display the results in ascending order of the means calculated. Put the code below in the right order.

```{r parsons}
question_parsons(
 initial = c(
    "summarise(xbar = mean(Sepal.Length))",
    "iris",
    "arrange(xbar)",
    "group_by(Species)"
 ),
 answer(c(
    "iris",
    "group_by(Species)",
    "summarise(xbar = mean(Sepal.Length))",
    "arrange(xbar)"
  ), correct = TRUE),
  problem_type = "tidyverse"
)
```

## Shiny

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sliderInput(
  "binwidth", 
  "Binwidth:", 
  min = 1, max = 30, value = 3
  )
plotOutput("hist")
```

```{r, context = "server"}
output$hist <- renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = input$binwidth) +
    labs(
      x = "Miles per gallon",
      y = "Frequency",
      title = "Distribution of MPG"
    )
})
