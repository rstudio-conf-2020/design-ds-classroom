## Analysis
  
Let's take a look at the voting history of countries in the United Nations General Assembly. We will be using data from the __unvotes__ package. Additionally, we will make use of the __tidyverse__ and __lubridate__ packages for the analysis, and the __DT__ package for interactive display of tabular output.

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
```

The unvotes package provides three datasets we can work with: `un_roll_calls`, `un_roll_call_issues`, and `un_votes`. Each of these datasets contains a variable called `rcid`, the roll call id, which can be used as a unique identifier to join them with each other.

- The `un_votes` dataset provides information on the voting history of the United Nations General Assembly. It contains one row for each country-vote pair.
- The `un_roll_calls` dataset contains information on each roll call vote of the United Nations General Assembly.
- The `un_roll_call_issues` dataset contains (topic) classifications of roll call votes of the United Nations General Assembly. Many votes had no topic, and some have more than one.

Let's create a visualization that we create a visualization that displays how the voting record of the United States changed over time on a variety of issues, and compares it to another country. The other country we'll display is Turkey.

```{r plot-yearly-yes-issue, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States of America", "Turkey")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  mutate(issue = ifelse(issue == "Nuclear weapons and nuclear material",
                        "Nuclear weapons and materials", issue)) %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    perc_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
    ) %>%
  filter(votes > 5) %>%  # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = perc_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ issue) +
    labs(
      title = "Percentage of Yes votes in the UN General Assembly",
      subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
      y = "% Yes",
      x = "Year",
      color = "Country"
    )
```

We can easily change which countries are being plotted by changing which countries the code above `filter`s for. Note that the country name should be spelled and capitalized exactly the same way as it appears in the data. See the [Appendix](#appendix) for a list of the countries in the data.
