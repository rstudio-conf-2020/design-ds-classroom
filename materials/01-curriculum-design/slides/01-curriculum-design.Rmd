## 2016 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)

1. Teach statistical thinking.  
  - Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision making.
  - Give students experience with multivariable thinking [...] to answer challenging questions that require them to investigate and explore relationships among many variables.
1. Focus on conceptual understanding. 
1. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
1. Foster active learning.
1. Use technology to explore concepts and analyse data.
1. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

### 01 - Curriculum design / `start-with-cake.Rmd`

- Your challenge is to go from nothing to a data visualisation in 15 minutes of your first class. Don't worry about the computing infrastructure (we'll get to that later in the day), assume students have successfully landed in RStudio Cloud like you did earlier. Design an exercise for them to "create" their first visualisation.
- If you need inspiration, you can use the `ggplot2::diamonds` or `dplyr::starwars` dataset or any dataset from `nycflights13` or `gapminder` packages.
- If you already have a first day exercise you like, you're welcomed to modify it to fit the challenge: from nothing to a data visualisation in 15 minutes!
- Compare notes with neighbors.

## Designing code snippets for teaching

- Write it out to your heart's desire and polish it

--

- Then, split into three parts:
  - `r emo::ji("package")` **Pre-process:** Required, but isn't directly connected to / far off from learning goals of current lesson
  - `r emo::ji("broken_heart")` **Stash:** Not required, and not directly connected to learning goals of current lesson 
    - Likely concepts that fit better into future lessons)
  - `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` **Feature:** Heart of the lesson (and maybe a review of a previous lessons)
  
- Finally, decide on the pace at which to scaffold and layer

---
