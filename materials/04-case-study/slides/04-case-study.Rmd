## Why RStudio in the cloud?

- Reduce friction at first exposure to R
- Avoid local installation
- Install R and RStudio on a server and provide access to students:
  - Centralized RStudio server __*__
  - Dockerized RStudio server __*__
  - RStudio Cloud

# Hello RStudio Cloud!

---

## What is RStudio Cloud?

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
.large[We created **RStudio Cloud** to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers, and students to do, share, teach, and learn data science using R.]
]

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-ide.png")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud.png")
```

---

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support
- Features designed for instructors:
  - Classes can be organized in workspaces
  - Members can be assigned different roles: instructor, TA, student
  - Projects can be public or private
  - Projects can be made into assignments 
  - Students can make copies of projects created by instructor
  - Instructor can peek into student projects
  - A base project template can ensure same packages in each new project created in the workspace
  - Git works out of the box

---

## Contexts

- Semester long courses
  - Intro data science / statistics: little to no background in stats, data science, programming
  - Upper level data science / statistics: Varied computing background and different computer setups
  
- Shorter workshops: Likely no opportunity to communicate pre-workshop instructions, varied computing background and learning goals

---

.your-turn[
Log out of RStudio Cloud and log back in.
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

---

## Workspaces

- When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own

- You can add a new workspace and control its permissions

- Projects in either workspace can be public or private

---

## Projects

- A new project in RStudio Cloud

- is basically a new project in the RStudio IDE

.alert[
**PSA:** If you use RStudio, use projects! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Find out more at r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html.
]

---

## Projects from Git

- A new project from Git Repo in RStudio Cloud
- is creates (cloning) a project from a Git repository RStudio

## Sharing an individual project

<br>

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- Changes you make after student launches the project won’t propagate to their project
]

---

.your-turn[

#### First you're the instructor:
- Create a new project and give it a name.
- Create a template R Markdown document in the project.
- Change the access level of the project so others can see it as well.
- Grab the project URL and share it with your neighbor:
- Tip: You can create a short link for the URL at bitly.com.

#### Now you're the student: 
Access your neighbor's project as if you're the student and they’re the instructor.

#### You’re the instructor:

- Create a new workspace and give it a name.
  - Tip: Check in with your neighbor and use a different name.
- Add a short description.

## Getting students into class workspace

#### Under the Membership tab:

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/workspace-access.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
- Make workspace shared for a short period of time, share link with students, enroll them as contributors.
- After drop/add switch over to this access level
- Use invitations for visitors added mid-semester
]

## Permission levels

| role        | permission                                       | course role |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| admin       | manage users, view, edit and manage all projects | instructor  |
| moderator   | view, edit and manage all projects               | TA          |
| contributor | create, edit and manage their own projects       | student     |
| viewer      | view projects shared with everyone               | auditor     |

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`  ]  ]

## Permissions

### Under the Membership tab:

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/permissions.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
- By default, all permissions are turned off
- Think carefully before checking these boxes
]

## Capacity

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/capacity.png")
```

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`  ]  ]

---

.your-turn[

#### You’re the instructor:

- Change the settings of your workspace to Shared.
- Change the permissions so that contributors or viewers can’t see the list of members and can’t change the visibility of their projects.

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3)

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`  ]  ]

---

.your-turn[

#### You’re the instructor:

- Add a base project to your workspace:
  - Install one or two of your favorite packages.
  - Start an R Markdown document so necessary packages get installed.
  - Add a code-of-conduct.md (you can copy-paste from [here](https://web.cvent.com/event/36ebe042-0113-44f1-8e36-b9bc5d0733bf/websitePage:988cd046-614c-445b-b658-1c8d83ca82b0) if you like) or some other plain text document.
- Make this project visible to everyone.
In the settings menu, set this project as the base project.
- Create a new assignment: `Homework 01`.

  - Optional: Make a short link for it.
- Share it with your neighbor.

## Git integration

Base project template can be used, so new project from git also has the right packages installed!

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-integration.png")
```

---

## Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments, which remove the need to remind students to make a copy of the project before starting work
- Ability to peek into students’ projects
]
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- You can update the base project throughout the course, but it will only be applied to projects created going forward

## `r emo::ji("parcel")` rscloud

- A new package for managing RStudio Cloud spaces with R: [github.com/rstudio/rscloud](https://github.com/rstudio/rscloud)
- Requires an API key, which any instructor can request (via email for now, but soon in the UI as well)

# Parting remarks

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student
